# Polyamorous

Polyamorous is an extraction from MetaSearch 1.1.x, Ransack, and Squeel by [Ernie Miller](http://twitter.com/erniemiller).

If you are using Polyamorous with Rails 4.1, you'll need the latest commits in the git repo that are not yet in the official gem release. In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'polyamorous', github: 'activerecord-hackery/polyamorous'
```
